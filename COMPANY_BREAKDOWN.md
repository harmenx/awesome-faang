## Tips for Multi-Company Prep

1. **Common patterns** across FAANG: Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, Hashmaps, Dynamic Programming  
2. **Behavioral prep**: STAR format works everywhere, but Amazon = leadership principles, Netflix = freedom & responsibility  
3. **System design**: Focus on scalability, trade-offs, reliability, and product relevance  
4. **Coding practice**: Blind 75 + company-tagged problems on LeetCode  
5. **Mock interviews**: Rotate between coding, system design, and behavioral to simulate real onsite
