# BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS (FAANG)

Behavioral interviews are elimination rounds. Most candidates fail here despite strong technical ability.

This document is a **practical playbook** for passing FAANG behavioral interviews with high signal.

---

## 1. What FAANG Is Actually Testing

Not personality. **Predictability under pressure.**

They assess:
- Ownership and accountability
- Decision-making with incomplete information
- Conflict handling
- Ability to learn fast from failure
- Communication clarity
- Leadership without authority

If they cannot predict your behavior in ambiguous, high-stakes situations, you fail.

---

## 2. STAR Framework (Correct Usage)

Most candidates misuse STAR. This is the correct compression:

**S – Situation**
- One sentence
- Business context only

**T – Task**
- What *you* were responsible for
- Not the team’s mission

**A – Action (70% of the answer)**
- Decisions you made
- Tradeoffs you considered
- What you explicitly did *not* do

**R – Result**
- Quantified outcome
- What changed because of *you*

**Always end with learning.**

---

## 3. Required Story Set (Non-Negotiable)

Prepare **2 stories per category**.

### Core
- Biggest failure
- Conflict with a strong peer
- Disagree-and-commit
- Ambiguous problem
- Tight deadline / pressure
- Influencing without authority

### Senior+ (if applicable)
- Driving org-level change
- Hiring or firing decision
- Long-term technical bet
- Mentoring someone who later succeeded

If you lack a category, you will be exposed.

---

## 4. Bar Raiser Signals (Amazon-heavy)

Strong signals:
- Admit mistakes early
- Show ownership beyond role
- Speak in mechanisms, not vibes
- Quantify impact
- Talk about tradeoffs

Weak signals (failures):
- Blaming others
- “We did X” everywhere
- No numbers
- Hero narratives
- Avoiding conflict

---

## 5. High-Frequency Questions + Intent

### “Tell me about a failure”
**They want:** self-awareness + learning speed

Bad answer:
- External blame
- Soft failure

Good answer:
- Real failure
- Early mistake
- Clear correction
- Changed future behavior

---

### “Describe a conflict”
**They want:** emotional regulation + judgment

Bad answer:
- Avoidance
- Emotional escalation

Good answer:
- Clear disagreement
- Calm escalation
- Resolution mechanism

---

### “A time you disagreed with your manager”
**They want:** backbone + alignment

Good answer structure:
- Data-backed disagreement
- Direct communication
- Commit after decision

---

### “Most ambiguous problem you worked on”
**They want:** clarity creation

Hit these points:
- Missing info
- Assumptions
- Decision framework
- Feedback loops

---

## 6. Language That Scores vs Fails

### Use
- “I decided…”
- “The tradeoff was…”
- “The risk was…”
- “The metric we moved was…”

### Avoid
- “We just felt…”
- “It kind of worked out…”
- “I don’t really remember…”

Precision = competence signal.

---

## 7. Behavioral Red Flags (Instant Fail)

- Inconsistent stories
- No ownership
- Defensiveness
- Rambling
- Contradicting resume claims

If detected, interview is effectively over.

---

## 8. Ending Strong (Most People Miss This)

End answers with:

> “What I changed going forward was…”

This converts experience into signal.

---

## 9. Preparation Checklist

- 10–12 stories total
- Each story < 2 minutes
- Each has numbers
- Each has learning
- Rehearsed out loud

---

## 10. Mental Model

Technical interviews test **ability**.

Behavioral interviews test **risk**.

Your goal: appear **low-risk, high-ownership, fast-learning**.

Nothing else matters.
